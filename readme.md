In this research we leverage the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2019 Farm to School Census, a new disaggregated database of state-level Farm to School Policies, and a new county-level dataset of stocks of community wealth to answer three questions:
1. Is there a relation between community wealth and Farm to School adoption and intensity?
2. Given the stocks of community wealth, are state-level legislation supporting procurement and education activities in Farm to School related to program participation?
3. Are there spatial spillover effects among School Food Authorities in FTS programming?
